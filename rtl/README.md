# RTL Directory

Currently tracking the NEORV32 VHDL core as the Linux-capable RISC-V implementation candidate (cloned at commit `cfcfda82`). Import or update the core using:

```bash
cd rtl
# Example: add as a git submodule or vendor copy
# git submodule add https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32.git neorv32
```

Once cloned, ensure the following:
- Core sources available under `rtl/neorv32/rtl/`.
- License headers preserved (NEORV32 is under BSD-3-Clause).
- Keep original directory layout to ease upstream merges.

# Legacy placeholder files were removed once the upstream repository was cloned.
