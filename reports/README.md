# Reports Directory

Build and compliance automation will store generated artefacts here:

- `reports/arch_tests/`: JSON/CSV summaries from riscv-arch-test runs.
- `reports/vivado/`: Timing/utilisation logs copied by baseline build scripts.
- `reports/perf/`: Future performance measurements for SNN accelerator benchmarks.

Subdirectories are created on demand by the helper scripts.
